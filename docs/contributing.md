# Contributing

Anyone with a GitHub account can contribute. 

1. Press the Fork button in the upper-right corner of the [NDR-matlab](https://github.com/VH-Lab/NDR-matlab/) GitHub repository to make a copy of NDR in your own GitHub space.

2. Add your own ndr.reader.base base object, as described in the tutorial. Be sure to write a test function. If any helper functions are
needed, be sure you have permission to add them, and add them to the `ndr.format` package or to the `lib` folder.

3. Commit your changes back to your fork.

4. Finally, issue a Pull Request on GitHub from your fork. The request will be received by the NDR development team for integration.
